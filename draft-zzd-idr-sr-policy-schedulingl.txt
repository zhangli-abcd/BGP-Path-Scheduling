              BGP SR Policy Extensions for Path Scheduling
                 draft-zzd-idr-sr-policy-scheduling-08

Abstract

   Segment Routing (SR) policy enables instantiation of an ordered list
   of segments with a specific intent for traffic steering.  When using
   SR policy in a time-variant network, delivering the time-variant
   information associated with paths is necessary in some scenarios.

   This document proposes extensions to BGP SR Policy to deliver the
   schedule information of candidate path (segment list) and its
   associated attributes.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC9657] introduces a set of time-variant network use cases where
   the topology of the network changes predictably.  When the networks
   uses traditional routing protocols, it takes these topology changes
   as unexpected events and may cause and packet loss.  However, the
   topology changes of these networks can be predicted in advance,
   therefore some measures can be taken in advance to prevent the packet
   loss.  With this idea, [I-D.ietf-tvr-requirements] describes the
   requirements of using the time-variant information in a network.  In
   Section 3.4.1 of [I-D.ietf-tvr-requirements], it describes the
   centralized routing scenarios with time-variant information, in which
   the network entities receive the time variable information and
   traffic forwarding rules directly from a logically centralized
   source(an Orchestrator or network controller).  The time-variant
   information is especially essential when there is a risk that a
   logically centralized source may loses connectivity with the network
   entities.

   Segment Routing (SR) policy [RFC9256] is a set of candidate SR paths
   consisting of one or more segment lists and necessary path
   attributes.  It describes the traffic forwarding rules for specific
   flows.  [I-D.ietf-idr-sr-policy-safi] introduces how BGP may be used
   to distribute SR Policy candidate paths.  It introduces a BGP SAFI
   with new NLRI to advertise the candidate paths and specific
   attributes of a SR Policy from a controller or path computation
   engine (PCE) to the network entities.  However, when using BGP SR
   Policy in a time-variant network, it can't advertise the schedule
   information associated with paths.

   This document proposes extensions to BGP SR Policy to carry the
   schedule information of candidate paths/segment lists.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Motivation

   Most of the time-variant network use cases using BGP SR Policy could
   be benefit from this work.  In some cases, carrying the time-variant
   information with SR Policy is essential.

   This section describes the cases that requires extending SR Policy
   with schedule information.

2.1.  Network with Discontinuous Links

   In some time-variant network cases, the links between the network
   entities and network controller may very weak or intermittent, this
   is very typical in Resource Preservation and Dynamic Reachability
   network[RFC9657].  In these cases, Real-time SR policy advertising
   (before changes occur) may not be timely.  For example, when a link
   of an old path is about to be disconnected, the network controller is
   going to advertise a new path to the headend.  However, the link
   between the headend and the network controller is not available.  As
   a result, the new path cannot be advertised in time, causing packet
   loss.

   Therefore, in these cases, once the links between the headend and
   network controller are available, the controller need to advertise
   the paths with schedule information for a period in the future to the
   headend.  Then the headend could determine valid paths in the future
   based on the schedule information of SR policy.

2.2.  Network with Frequent Topology Changes

   There are also some time-variant network cases that topology changes
   frequently.  This is very typical when the number of network entities
   is very large (For example, a Dynamic Reachability network with
   hundreds or thousands of nodes).  In this kind of time-variant
   network, a path form one network entity to another changes
   frequently, sometimes it can only be maintained for a few minutes or
   seconds.

   Considering that there are multiple paths in a network that computed
   by the controller, the SR Policies with candidate paths may be
   advertised to the headend every few seconds.  It poses great
   changeling to the network controller.  However, using schedule
   information could advertise several paths once, which greatly
   mitigate the pressure of network controllers.

3.  Schedule Information in SR Policy

   The NLRI defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy] contains
   the SR Policy candidate path.  The content of the SR Policy Candidate
   Path is encoded in the Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute defined in
   [RFC9012] using a new Tunnel-Type called SR Policy Type with
   codepoint 15.  The SR Policy encoding structure is as follows:

   SR Policy SAFI NLRI: <Distinguisher, Policy-Color, Endpoint>
         Attributes:
            Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute (23)
               Tunnel Type: SR Policy (15)
                   Binding SID
                   SRv6 Binding SID
                   Preference
                   Priority
                   Policy Name
                   Policy Candidate Path Name
                   Explicit NULL Label Policy (ENLP)
                   Segment List
                       Weight
                       Segment
                       Segment
                       ...
                   ...

   A candidate path includes multiple SR paths, each of which is
   specified by a segment list.  The schedule information can be applied
   to a candidate path, indicating the valid time for each candidate
   path and its associated attributes.  The new SR Policy encoding
   structure is expressed as below:

   SR Policy SAFI NLRI: <Distinguisher, Policy-Color, Endpoint>
         Attributes:
            Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute (23)
               Tunnel Type: SR Policy (15)
                   Binding SID
                   SRv6 Binding SID
                   Preference
                   Priority
                   Policy Name
                   Policy Candidate Path Name
                   Explicit NULL Label Policy (ENLP)
                   Schedule Information
                   Segment List
                       Weight
                       Segment
                       Segment
                       ...
                   ...

   The schedule Information also can be applied to a segment list to
   indicate the valid time for a segment list and its associated
   attributes.  The new SR Policy encoding structure is expressed as
   below:

   SR Policy SAFI NLRI: <Distinguisher, Policy-Color, Endpoint>
         Attributes:
            Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute (23)
               Tunnel Type: SR Policy (15)
                   Binding SID
                   SRv6 Binding SID
                   Preference
                   Priority
                   Policy Name
                   Policy Candidate Path Name
                   Explicit NULL Label Policy (ENLP)
                   Segment List
                       Schedule Information
                       Weight
                       Segment
                       Segment
                       ...
                   ...

   slot for one or more paths.  The format of schedule information sub-

                       Figure 2: Format of Schedules

   Schedule-id: 32-bit value, the unique identifier to distinguish each
   schedule within a SR Policy, this value is allocated by the SR Policy
   generator.

   Flags: 8 bits, currently only 2 bits are used, the other bits are
   reserved.

   Length: 8 bits, indicates the length of this schedule in octets.

   S (Schedule type): one-bit flag to indicate the type of a schedule.
   If S=0, it indicates the schedule only has one instance, the
   Recurrence Count/Bound, Frequency and Interval field should not be
   included in the sub-TLV; If S=1, it indicates the schedule has
   multiple instances, the Recurrence Count/Bound, Frequency and
   Interval field should be included.

   P (Period type): one-bit flag to indicate the description type of a
   period. if P=1, then the period is described by a start time filed
   and an end time field; If P =0, then the period is described by a
   start time field and a duration time field.

   R (Recurrence bound type): one-bit flag to indicate the how to
   determine whether the recurrence is end. if R=1, then the end of
   recurrence is determined by a detail timepoint; If R = 0, then the
   end of the recurrence is determined by the number of occurrences.

   Start Time: 64-bit value, the number of seconds since the epoch, it
   indicates when the candidate path (segment list) and its associated
   attributes start to take effect.

   End Time (Duration): 64-bit value, if the flag P=1, then it is the
   number of seconds since the epoch, it indicates when the candidate
   path (segment list) and its associated attributes becomes
   ineffective.  If the flag P=0, then it is the number of seconds since
   the Start Time, it indicates how long the candidate path (segment
   list) and its associated attributes are effective.

   Recurrence Count/Bound(optional): 64-bit value, this field SHOULD be
   included when the flag P is set to 1.  When the flag R=0, then this
   field indicates the max number of occurrences.  For example, if it is
   set to 2, then the schedule will repeat twice with the specified
   Frequency and Interval.  When the flag R=1, then tis field indicates
   the bounded timepoint of recurrence, it is descripted by the number
   of seconds since the epoch.

   Frequency(optional): 32-bit value, this field should be included when
   the flag S is set to 1.  It is the numbers of seconds since the Start
   Time of an instance to the Start Time of next instance.  This field
   indicates the recurrence frequency for all the instance of this
   schedule.

5.  Operations

5.1.  Advertisement of SR Policies with Schedule Information

   As described in Section 4.1 of [I-D.ietf-idr-sr-policy-safi],
   typically, an SR Policy is computed by a controller or a path
   computation engine (PCE) and originated by a BGP speaker on its
   behalf.  The schedule information is also computed by a controller or
   a PCE which can access to all the predicted topology changes.  The
   predicted topology changes could be got from management interfaces or
   other means.

   The controller or PCE SHOULD maintain a time-variant event database
   as described in Section 6 of [I-D.zdm-tvr-applicability] to store all
   the predicted information, and compute SR Policies with schedule
   information based on the database.

   Each Candidate Path or Segment List may have multiple schedules, each
   schedule is identified by schedule-id, the controller or PCE MUST
   make the schedule-id unique within a specific SR Policy.

   The controller or PCE MUST ensure that the BGP speakers who will
   receive the SR Policy with schedule information have the capability
   to deal with the schedule information.

5.2.  Reception of an SR Policy with Schedule Information

5.2.1.  Validation of Schedule Information

   On reception of an SR Policy, a BGP speaker first determines if it is
   valid as described in Section 4.2.1 of [I-D.ietf-idr-sr-policy-safi].
   When a headend receives a SR Policy form it neighbors or controller,
   it SHOULD perform schedule information validation based on the
   following rules:

   *  The headend MUST NOT use the SR Policy with schedule information
      when it does not have the capability to deal with the schedule
      information.

   *  When multiple schedules are present within one SR Policy, the
      schedule-id of each schedules MUST be different.  If there are
      multiple schedules with the same schedule-id, then the SR Policy
      MUST be considered as malformed.

   *  The Start Time of Schedule Information TLV MUST be later than the
      time it be received, if not, the SR Policy MUST be considered as
      malformed.

   *  If the End Time/Duration field is used to indicated the end time,
      then it MUST be later than the Start Time, if not, the SR Policy
      MUST be considered as malformed.

   *  If the Frequency field is present in the Schedule Information TLV,
      then it MUST be greater than the difference between the End Time
      and Start Time(P=1), or greater than the Duration(P=0), if not,
      the SR Policy MUST be considered as malformed.

   *  If the Recurrence Count/Bound field is present and used to
      indicate the boundary time point, then it MUST be greater than the
      End Time(P=1), or greater than the sum of Start Time and
      Duration(P=0), if not, the SR Policy MUST be considered as
      malformed.

   If a headend receives a SR Policy that considered as malformed, then
   the SR Policy MUST NOT be used.

   As described in [I-D.ietf-idr-sr-policy-safi], the BGP SR Policy is
   distinguished by <distinguisher, color, endpoint> tuple.  Whenever a
   headend receives a SR Policy that it has received before, the SR
   Policy is considered as the fully replacement of the old one.

5.2.2.  Enable/Disable Candidate Paths/Segment Lists

   When a headend receives a SR Policy with schedule information, it
   SHOULD parse the SR Policy and save the schedule information locally.
   When a data packet arrives, it will steer it to a specific SR Policy
   by color or other means.

   Within a specific SR Policy, the headend dynamically enable/desable
   different Candidate Paths/Segment Lists based on the schedule
   information.

6.  Security Considerations

   TBD

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a sub-TLV in the registry "BGP Tunnel
   Encapsulation Attribute sub-TLVs" to be assigned by IANA:

           +=======+===========================+===============+
           | Value | Description               | Reference     |
           +=======+===========================+===============+
           | TBD1  | Schedule Information (SI) | This document |
           +-------+---------------------------+---------------+

                                  Table 1

   The type value of this sub-TLV is recommended to be token from the
   range of 64-125(First Come First Served).
